# Blood Management System allows hospital to communicate between each other for the most efficient use of blood. 

Description: <br>
Hospital is first registered in our website, where it is asked of details about the hospital. The hospital when registered will enter regularly the blood flow to and from the hosptial. The hospital can request a blood bag with a button, and the request will be sent to the most appropriate hospital based on its location and the blood bags available with the hospital. The hospital can also accept or reject blood requests from other hospitals.
